## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Drop Fruits**: Click anywhere on the game area or use the "Drop Fruit" button to release fruits
2. **Merge Strategy**: When two identical fruits touch, they merge into the next fruit in the evolution chain
3. **Stack Carefully**: Fruits stack with realistic physics - plan your drops to create efficient merges
4. **Avoid Game Over**: Don't let fruits pile up above the danger line for too long
5. **Score Points**: Earn points for each successful merge - bigger fruits = more points!

## 🍇 Fruit Evolution Chain

```
🍒 → 🍓 → 🫐 → 🍇 → 🥝 → 🍋 → 🍊 → 🍎 → 🍑 → 🥭 → 🍍 → 🥥
```

Start with cherries and work your way up to the ultimate coconut!

### Key Technologies
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For game rendering and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Core game logic and physics engine
- **CSS3**: Modern styling and responsive design
- **Apache Cordova**: Mobile app packaging

### Game Physics
The game implements a custom physics engine featuring:
- **Collision Detection**: Circle-based collision with optimized algorithms
- **Velocity Calculations**: Realistic momentum and bounce effects
- **Separation Logic**: Anti-compression system prevents unrealistic stacking
- **Boundary Handling**: Proper wall and floor collision responses

## 🎯 Game Mechanics Deep Dive

### Collision System
- **Detection**: Efficient distance-based collision detection
- **Resolution**: Physics-based separation with velocity dampening
- **Merging**: Automatic fruit evolution when identical fruits collide
- **Boundaries**: Proper handling of wall and floor interactions

### Scoring Algorithm
- **Base Points**: Each fruit type has a base point value
- **Merge Bonus**: Additional points for successful combinations
- **Chain Reactions**: Bonus multipliers for consecutive merges
- **Size Scaling**: Larger fruits provide exponentially more points

### Difficulty Progression
- **Fruit Variety**: Random selection from available fruit types
- **Preview System**: Strategic planning with next fruit visibility
- **Danger Zone**: Escalating tension as fruits approach the limit
- **Game Over**: Clear failure conditions with recovery options
